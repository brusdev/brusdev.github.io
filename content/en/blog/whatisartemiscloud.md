ArtemisCloud is a collection of container images to allow users to deploy the ActiveMQ Artemis Broker from a simple standalone docker image to a fully blown Operator controlled deployment. 

 Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is a multi protocol message broker that is hosted at Apache as part of the ActiveMQ umbrella. For more on the Apache Artemis Broker take a look at the [documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/).
