The best way to contact folks in the community is by using one of the mailing lists. We have two main mailing lists - the users@artemiscloud.io list and the devs@artemiscloud.io list. Choose the right list based on whether you’re deploying or using ArtemisCloud or you’re a developer working directly on one of the ArtemisCloud code-bases.
